Firstly put the name of the entity in the collisiontable and put all of its collision with the "alt-22" sign

secondly add the name of the entity in the "Enums.h" file under "Alignment"

Thirdly add the previously named collisions in the collisionmap (which is in the Init() function in the entitymanager)

Lastly you add the animations/sprites etc in the AttachEntity() function
